    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and easily debuggable solution for the VideoKoleks application. The design prioritizes authorization independence, clarity of intent, and adherence to the DBAC principle (database-based access control). It employs denormalization and structural segregation to simplify security rules and enable efficient data access. Path-based ownership is favored for user-owned data, and membership maps are used for collaborative data.\n\n1.  **Authorization Independence:**\n    *   The structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies (`get()`) by denormalizing authorization context. Specifically, `userId` is included in both `Video` and `Category` documents. This allows security rules to validate ownership without needing to fetch the parent `User` document, ensuring atomic operations and easier debugging.\n\n2.  **Clarity of Intent (Debuggability):**\n    *   The structure uses clear and consistent naming conventions for collections and documents (e.g., `/users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}`).\n    *   Explicit ownership is enforced using the `userId` field.\n\n3.  **DBAC (No Custom Claims):**\n    *   Authorization relies solely on `request.auth.uid`, with roles stored directly within the documents (e.g., `userId` field represents the owner).\n\n4.  **QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n    *   Secure `list` operations are supported by structural segregation. Each collection (e.g., `/users/{userId}/videos`) has a homogeneous security posture, ensuring that rules can effectively control access to all documents within the collection.\n\n**Denormalization Strategy:**\n\n*   The `Video` and `Category` collections include the `userId` field, which is a foreign key referencing the `User` document. This denormalization is crucial for authorization independence, enabling security rules to validate ownership without performing additional `get()` operations.\n\n**Structural Segregation:**\n\n*   The structure separates user-specific data into subcollections under the `/users/{userId}` path. This segregation ensures that each user's data has a distinct security context, simplifying access control rules."
