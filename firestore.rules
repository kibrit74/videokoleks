/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for VideoKoleks Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user has exclusive control over their profile, categories, and videos.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Video categories owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}: Video information owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - No public data access is permitted.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization and relationship enforcement during this prototyping phase.
 * - The system authenticates with password or anonymous authentication, so rules only check for a valid `request.auth` context.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  -  The data structure inherently enforces ownership via path-based security. No denormalization is required because user id is directly encoded in the paths.
