/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VideoKoleks application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has complete
 * control over their own categories and videos, and no access to others' data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, creating a clear ownership hierarchy.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public profile information for each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores category data owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}: Stores video data owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No global roles or administrative overrides are implemented.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 * - The rules prioritize simplicity and clarity, leveraging path-based ownership
 *   to minimize the need for complex data validation or external lookups.
